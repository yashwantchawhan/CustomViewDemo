# CustomViewDemo
This app has sample example for custom view usage.

Creating your own view gives you control over the appearance and function of a view element. 

To give an idea of the control you get with custom views, here are some examples, I have built using custom views:

1. LengthPicker

2. Pizza slice

3. PhotoSpiral

4. SquareView

5. SideShowsSLayout
